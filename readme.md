# About
This is a small project for finding a day of the week from a given date and
displaying a calendar using some very simple HTML and JavaScript.

This is probably not the fastest method of doing so, probably not the best
method of packaging this, and there are almost certainly libraries that already
do this.

I would recommend using the built-in `Date` library, but this is just a nice
little coding challenge that avoids using it. The library is only used once to
initialize the calendar to the current date.
